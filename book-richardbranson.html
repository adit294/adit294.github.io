            <p>Entertaining read where Branson shares his and Virgins story to success as well as sharing how he survived everything from drowning, freezing and near death experiences during his adventures around the world.</p>
            <p>The book is more like a fiction novel than an autobiography where the protagonist comes out as this really adventurous hero who knows how to live his life to the fullest. It lets you into Richard Branson’s life and how he came up with more than 400 different companies under the same brand umbrella of Virgin.</p>
            <p>From a college magazine to this huge conglomerate and a really successful brand that Virgin is today, this book summarizes the extra-ordinary journey of Richard Branson's success from scratch.</p>

            <p>His enthusiasm spills over to his adventurous spirit as well — He provides riveting accounts of his attempts to fly in a hot air balloon across the Atlantic, Pacific and finally, the world. His daring rescue of refugees in Baghdad after personally corresponding with Saddam Hussein is unforgettable. His charitable work in Africa with the help of Nelson Mandela is remarkable, as well his fight against climate change.</p>
            <p>His unrelenting enthusiasm to step into new waters is utterly inspiring — from stepping into the airlines industry, to building carbon-composite reusable spacecraft, setting up Virgin Cola, and building powerful trains. I admire what he has accomplished through hard work, vision and wit. His story is insightful, motivational, and more importantly — useful. He is a perfect combination of serious and fun.</p>
