This repository has the code for my personal website  - https://aditagarwal.com  where I write articles on matters that i feel strongly about. All code is hosted here on github. 
Some links are not directly navigable like:-

. An AI powered connect four that i developed using AI and algorithms like minimax - https://aditagarwal.com/connect4  (recommend only desktop use as of now, some bugs yet to be fixed for mobile)

. A text to speech converter https://aditagarwal.com/text_to_speech/
